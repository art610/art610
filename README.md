- 👋 Hi, I'm Artem Zhelonkin (@artif467 or @art610)
- 👀 I'm interested in Python, Linux, Bash, API (Postman), SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), Redis Cache, Hadoop, NGINX (sometimes Apache), and CI/CD/DevOps Stack: Git (Semantic Versioning, Conventional Commits, Pull Requests, Issues, Projects, Milestones), Github Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible (Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration), Hashicorp Terraform (IaaC is incredible), Kubernetes (Containers Orchestration), Grafana and other excellent tools. 
- 🌱 I prefer AWS, GCP, Selectel as Cloud Services Providers.
- 💞️ I'm just trying to make myself and our world better working day by day without holidays and weekends. But sometimes I can take a break - Nobody's Perfect.
